Code of Conduct
---------------

Please refer to the :ref:`code_of_conduct`.

Releases
--------

The release process of LibSWIFFT aims to ensure each released version:

* has fully documented API;
* has passed all tests;
* has good code coverage;
* has performance comparable or better than that of the previous version;
* follows semantic versioning rules (see below).

A release version, which appears with the prefix "v" in a repository tag, has
the structure `x.y.z`:

* `x` is the major version, incrementing on a backward-incompatible change,
  which happen rarely and only with strong justification.
* `y` is the minor version, incrementing on backward-compatible enhancement,
  which happens normally and often involves extending the APIs.
* `z` is the patch version, incrementing on a bug fix, which does not change the
  APIs.

For more details, read about `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_.
